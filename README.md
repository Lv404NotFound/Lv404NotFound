        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Lv404NotFound, also known as Louis-Victor Gimenez. By day, I'm a system engineer, but in my free time, I'm a passionate game developer. I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40k, and I love playing as the Orks and the Salamanders. I'm also really into F1, especially the mechanics behind it. I started creating games through game jams, and my group and I have already participated in two of them. It's been an amazing experience, and I can't wait to continue making more games and sharing them with the community.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working on a game on my own and I'm looking for an artist to collaborate with. If you're interested, please feel free to reach out!</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Memory House:</strong> A fast-paced memory puzzle game created for ðŸŽƒ Halloween Game Jam 2024 ðŸŽƒ using Unity and Photoshop. [Link]</p>
        <p><strong>Sleep Tight:</strong> A 3D pixel art puzzle game developed for Pirate Software - Game Jam 15 using Unity, Blender, Aseprite, and Photoshop. [Link]</p>

        <h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
        <p>I am proficient in various game development tools and technologies, including Unity, Godot, C#, Blender, Maya, Photoshop, and Aseprite.</p>

        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>I hope to one day create a chill open-world game with rich lore where players can wander, learn, and enjoy a relaxing experience. I also aspire to learn how to make original soundtracks to enhance the 
         immersive experience of my games.</p>

        <h2>Top 5 Games</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Void Stranger</strong> - For its intriguing gameplay and unique mechanics.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Outer Wilds</strong> - For its captivating exploration and storytelling.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</strong> - For its intense action and connection to my favorite universe.</p>
