## About Me

Hey there! I'm Lv404NotFound, also known as Louis-Victor Gimenez. By day, I'm a system engineer, but in my free time, I'm a passionate game developer. I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40k, and I love playing as the Orks and the Salamanders. I'm also really into F1, especially the mechanics behind it. I started creating games through game jams, and my group and I have already participated in two of them. It's been an amazing experience, and I can't wait to continue making more games and sharing them with the community.

I'm currently working on a game on my own and I'm looking for an artist to collaborate with. If you're interested, please feel free to reach out!

## My Projects

**Memory House:** A fast-paced memory puzzle game created for 🎃 Halloween Game Jam 2024 🎃 using Unity and Photoshop.

**Sleep Tight:** A 3D pixel art puzzle game developed for Pirate Software - Game Jam 15 using Unity, Blender, Aseprite, and Photoshop.

**Bad Burrito Brunch:** A 3D pixel art puzzle game developed for Pirate Software - Game Jam 16 using Unity, Blender.

## Skills and Tools

I am proficient in various game development tools and technologies, including Unity, Godot, C#, Blender, Maya, Photoshop, and Aseprite.

## Future Goals

I hope to one day create a chill open-world game with rich lore where players can wander, learn, and enjoy a relaxing experience. I also aspire to learn how to make original soundtracks to enhance the immersive experience of my games.
