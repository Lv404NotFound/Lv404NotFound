About me
Hey there! I'm Lv404NotFound, also known as L-v. By day, I'm a system engineer, but in my free time, I'm a passionate game developer. I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40k, and I love playing as the Orks and the Salamanders. I'm also really into F1, especially the mechanics behind it. I started creating games through game jams, and my group and I have already participated in two of them. It's been an amazing experience, and I can't wait to continue making more games and sharing them with the community.

I'm currently working on a game on my own and I'm looking for an artist to collaborate with. If you're interested, please feel free to reach out!

My Projects
Memory House: A fast-paced memory puzzle game created for 🎃 Halloween Game Jam 2024 🎃 using Unity and Photoshop.

Sleep Tight: A 3D pixel art puzzle game developed for Pirate Software - Game Jam 15 using Unity, Blender, Aseprite, and Photoshop. (https://lv404notfound.itch.io/sleep-tight)

Skills and Tools
I am proficient in various game development tools and technologies, including Unity, Godot, C#, Blender, Maya, Photoshop, and Aseprite.

Future Goals
I hope to one day create a chill open-world game with rich lore where players can wander, learn, and enjoy a relaxing experience. I also aspire to learn how to make original soundtracks to enhance the immersive experience of my games.

Top 5 Games
1. Void Stranger - For its intriguing gameplay and unique mechanics.

2. Outer Wilds - For its captivating exploration and storytelling.

3. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - For its intense action and connection to my favorite universe.

4. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader - For its strategic depth and immersive universe.

5. Katana ZERO - For its fast-paced action and stylish presentation.
